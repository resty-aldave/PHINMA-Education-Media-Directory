## 📖 Project Overview

The **PHINMA Education Media Directory** is an independent, student-led initiative developed by a team from **Southwestern University PHINMA**. 

It serves as a digital bridge for students and the community, organizing official websites, verified social media pages, and contact information into a clear, navigable hierarchy. This project demonstrates student proactivity in creating digital solutions that simplify information discovery within the PHINMA Education network.
