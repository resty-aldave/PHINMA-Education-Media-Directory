## 📖 Project Overview
The **PHINMA Education Media Directory** is a centralized web portal designed to provide students and staff with quick access to all official institutional links. The interface features a modern aesthetic with synchronized orbital background elements.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Centralized Hub:** One-stop access for all official media.
* **Synchronized Orbitals:** 4 animated "blobs" rotating perfectly around the screen center ($50vw$, $50vh$).
* **Safe Deployment:** Enforced branch protection ensures no direct pushes to `main` or `stage`.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- **Positioning:** Uses fixed viewport units (`vw`/`vh`) for responsiveness.
- **Visuals:** Heavy Gaussian blurs (`99px`) and opacity filtering for a "glassmorphism" vibe.
- **Workflow:** Strictly requires Pull Requests before merging.
